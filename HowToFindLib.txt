assuming i want to compile something with libusb 
so after installing it via sudo or even building it from source it should be found in 

ll /usr/include/ | grep usb
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4,0K MÃ¤r 19  2019 libusb-1.0/
-rw-r--r--   1 root root 8,4K Apr 19  2017 usb.h

now it got a subfolder

ll /usr/include/libusb-1.0/
-rw-r--r--   1 root root  70K Jun 24  2017 libusb.h

hence 

#include <libusb-1.0/libusb.h>

and add "-llibusb-1.0" to your cmake or make file
